# Rtglm

Similar to EpiEstim [1], Rtglm [2] is a tool to estimate the time-varying instantaneous reproduction number during epidemics.
The key difference between EpiEstim and Rtglm are:
- Rtglm relies on a generalisation of the renewal equation, which allows inference within the Generalized Linear Model framework.
- Rtglm can largely reproduce EpiEstim results, i.e. in the simple application of EpiEstim (e.g. estimating Rt when daily incidence is known and information on the Generation time is know), with or without overalpping time-windows.
- Rtglm can estimate smooth version of temporal and spatial trends in Rt, relying on GAM (i.e. Genralized Additive Models). Currently, Rtglm internally call the 'gam' function of the mgcv R-package.

To install the latest version, use:
```r
devtools::install_github("pnouvellet/Rtglm",build = TRUE)
```

### Vignette

A vignette is available to demonstrate how to use key functionalities of Rtglm, including:
- How to reproduce EpiEstim results,
- Perform temporal smoothing relying on GAM models,
- Perform spatial smoothing relying on GAM models.

Please see the vignette html output [here](https://pnouvellet.github.io/Rtglm/Rtglm.html).

You can download the vignette .rmd file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnouvellet/Rtglm/refs/heads/master/docs/Rtglm.Rmd).
