\title{Wrapper to run the glm version of EpiEstim}
\usage{
glm_Rt_wrap(I_incid, si_distr, t_window, overlap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{I_incid}{A dataframe of non-negative integers with two columns, so that
\code{I_incid$local} contains the incidence of cases due to local transmission
and \code{I_incid$imported} contains the incidence of imported cases (with
\code{I_incid$local + I_incid$imported} the total incidence).}

\item{si_distr}{a vector containing
the discrete serial interval distribution(s) used for estimation. 
This is equivalent to the input in EpiEstim when using the "non_parametric_si"
method.}

\item{t_window}{a single integer characterising the time-window to be used. During
a time-window, the Rt is assumed to be constant. Time-windows may be overlapping 
or not (see overlap parameter)}

\item{overlap}{a logical, TRUE or FALSE, indicating whether time-window used for estimation
should overlap. by default, overlap is set at FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list including all results, including:

config: a record of the configuration, i.e. a list including the parameters
             t_window and overlap

model: the output of the glm model (equivalent to the output when running mgcv::gam);

Rt: a dataframe, including the time step for estimation; the mean, lower and higher 
             quantile (95% CI), and standard deviation in the estimated Rt at each time 
             step (center of each time-window).
